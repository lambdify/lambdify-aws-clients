## AWS Java Lightweight Clients
The lightweight version of AWS SDK for java. It its main focus is provide a low footprint client for AWS Lambda functions,
making the cold-start times lower.

## Why another AWS Java SDK?
Amazon Web Services used to have a standard Java SDK which depends on a set of third-party libraries to make their
development routine easier. Although it is a great solution and works very well, due to the nature of how AWS Lambda
loads your functions, it may lead to long cold start times.

This projects aims to provide a set of clients that were designed to have the least possible set of dependencies, ensuring you will have a very lightweight zip to deploy your functions.
